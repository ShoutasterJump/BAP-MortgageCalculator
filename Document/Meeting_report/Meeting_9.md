### Agenda: 
 feedback for our formal documentation. 
   

### Discussions: 
* Reviewing Diagrams and Adding Database Interaction:
We recently reviewed diagrams, and John shared some insightful ideas about various UML diagrams and their applications.
Following the feedback, it's noted that we haven't included database interaction in our use case, class, and activity diagrams, which is crucial.
Considering our web application's reliance on a database, it's essential to incorporate database interactions during the design phase. This ensures that our diagrams accurately represent the system's architecture and functionalities.
* Incorporating SeleniumHQ for UAT Testing:
As part of User Acceptance Testing (UAT), we plan to integrate SeleniumHQ.
SeleniumHQ will be utilized for UAT testing purposes, enhancing our ability to validate the functionality and user experience of the web application effectively.
This addition to our testing toolkit strengthens our overall testing strategy and ensures comprehensive testing coverage for the project.

### Conclusion: &nbsp;
After careful consideration and planning, our next step is coding.
