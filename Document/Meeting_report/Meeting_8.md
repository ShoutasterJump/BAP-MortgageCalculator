### Discussions: 

* Areas to Cover for Four Levels of Test Framework:
We will utilize four levels of testing: unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and User Acceptance Testing (UAT).
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules.
Integration testing focuses on testing the interaction between different components/modules.
System testing examines the entire system's functionality.
UAT ensures the system meets business requirements and user expectations.

* Task Separation and Deadline Setting:
Tasks are divided as follows:
Katherine is responsible for completing unit testing and integration testing.
Alex is responsible for conducting system testing and UAT.
Alex will conduct an overall review to identify areas for improvement, changes, and refine the wording to ensure a high-quality report.
Katherine will format the report and perform a final check for any typos or errors.
Our target submission deadline for the second assignment is set for before 21/04.
